# Drum Application

This application was created by Kevin Flynn (C18502203).

One folder is contained in this repository: 'DrumMachineTest1'.

This folder contains every file that is necessary to run the application.

Six individual files are contained in this repository: 'MainActivity.java', 'MainActivity2.java', 'MainActivity3.java', 'activity_main.xml', 'activity_main2.xml' and 'activity_main3.xml'.

These six files are also located inside the folder, but have been pasted outside the folder for easy viewing, as they are the most important files in this application.

The three MainActivity.java files are heavily commented, making the code easy to understand.

I would like to thank my project supervisor, Ray Lynch, for his consistent feedback and suggestions which have helped me improve the quality of this application.

Thank you for reading.
